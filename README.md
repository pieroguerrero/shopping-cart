- Thecnically in this project I used React and TailwindCSS.
- React router was used for routing and fetch to interact with the API, which is a free API aimed to provide fashion products for a testing ecommerce site. (https://fakestoreapi.com/)
- The project is structured following the Clean architecture best practices.
- Part of the data from the API was stored in order to have a fallback in case the API gets down.
